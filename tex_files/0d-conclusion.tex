Electric and magnetic dipole moments of particles are sensitive to physics within and beyond the Standard Model.


%In this thesis, sensitivity studies for the measurement of the Lambda baryon electromagnetic dipole moments based on pseudo experiments will be performed. In addition, the possibility of a first measurement using data collected with the LHCb detector will be explored.
