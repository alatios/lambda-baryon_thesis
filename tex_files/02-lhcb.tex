At the moment of writing, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC for short) is the largest and most powerful particle collider in the world.
When the LHC was first approved by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in 1994, it was originally going to be built with an initial center-of-mass collision energy of \SI{10}{\tev}, with the plan to upgrade it to \SI{14}{\tev} at a later stage;
however, after negotiations with nonmember states, in 1996 the CERN council approved the construction at \SI{14}{\tev} energy in one stage \cite{doi:10.1146/annurev-nucl-102010-130438}.
First collisions were obtained in 2010 at center-of-mass energy of \SI{7}{\tev}, with the current world record of \SI{13}{\tev} being achieved in 2015 after the first Long Shutdown.

LHC is located at the CERN laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, housed in the underground tunnel previously occupied by the LEP experiment.
Its structure, sketched in Figure \ref{fig:2:lhc_diagram}, consists of two counterrotating rings hosting beams for particle-particle collisions (mainly protons, but LHC is also used for ion collisions).

Four main experiments are stationed at the LHC rings intersection points:
ATLAS and CMS are high-luminosity experiments focused on general purpose proton-proton collisions; ALICE is optimized for lead-on-lead collisions with lower center-of-mass energy and luminosity compared to the former two; finally, LHCb is dedicated on the study of $b$ hadrons and will be the focus of the rest of this Chapter.
Beyond the above four, a number of small-scale, more specialized experiments also work with LHC, such as TOTEM, MilliQan and MoEDAL.


\section{The LHCb experiment and detector}

\end{figure}

LHCb (the \textit{b} stands for \textit{beauty}\footnote{Before settling on the names \textit{top} and \textit{bottom} for the third generation of quarks, the names \textit{truth} and \textit{beauty} were among those proposed. While they never gained enough momentum in the scientific community, echoes of the failed nomenclature are still present in heavy quark vocabulary, for instance in the alternative name \textit{truth} for the \textit{topness} flavour number mentioned in Section \ref{sec:flavour-physics}, as well as in the official name for the LHCb experiment.}) is a single-arm detector designed to study heavy-flavour physics at the LHC, with the main objective of providing precision measurements of CP violation and rare decays of $b$ and $c$ hadrons \cite{Alves:1129809}.

Unlike the other three main experiments at LHC, LHCb has a forward-optimized geometry shown in Figure \ref{fig:2:lhcb_diagram}, with an angular acceptance of $10\div300$ \si{\mrad} in the bending plane and $10\div250$ \si{\mrad} in the non-bending plane.
Such a layout, more reminiscent of fixed target experiments than beam colliders, is motivated by the fact that $b\bar{b}$ pairs produced at high energies are usually collimated in the same forward/backward cone.
A more in-depth look at the tracking and particle identification systems will be taken in Sections \ref{sec:2:tracking} and \ref{sec:2:pid} respectively.
\label{info:LHCb_system}
The standard LHCb coordinate system, used as reference for the rest of this thesis, is a right-handed system centered on the beam interaction point, with the $z$ axis along the the beam pipe and $y$ axis directed vertically upwards.

\subsection{Tracking}
\label{sec:2:tracking}
In order to measure the momenta of charged particles through their bending curve, LHCb employs a dipole magnet \cite{Amato:424338} consisting of two trapezoidal coils bent at $45^\circ$ on the two transverse sides, seen in Figure \ref{fig:2:lhcb_diagram} around $z\approx \SI{5}{\meter}$ (the magnet is placed so that the line connecting the centers of the pole faces crosses $z=\SI{5.3}{\meter}$).

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{graphics/02-lhcb/b_field_map_z.png}
	\caption[LHCb magnetic field along the $z$ axis.]{LHCb magnetic field along the $z$ axis \cite{Amato:424338}.}
	\label{fig:2:b_field_map_z}
\end{figure}

This magnet provides an integrated field of $\int B dl \approx \pm \SI{4}{\tesla\meter}$ for \SI{10}{\meter} tracks\footnote{The $\pm$ sign is due to the fact that the magnet operates alternatively in up and down polarities, inverting the sign of the magnetic field.}.
Most of this field is contained in the $z\in[2.5,7.95]$ \si{\meter} region, with 
a small fraction ($\int B dl \approx \SI{0.12}{\tesla\meter}$) upstream of $z=\SI{2.5}{\meter}$. The field map along $z$, measured with a precision of $4 \times {10}^{-4}$, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:2:b_field_map_z} for $x=y=0$.
Dishomogeneities in the $xy$ plane for fixed $z$ are estimated at $\lesssim 6\%$ within the LHCb detector acceptance.

\subsubsection{VELO}
As the name suggests, the VErtex LOcator (VELO) system \cite{Barbosa-Marinho:504321} is designed to provide precision measurements of charged tracks near the beam interaction point, in order to correctly reconstruct detached secondary vertices typical of $b$- and $c$-hadron decays.

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graphics/02-lhcb/VELO_xy.png}
	\caption[Front view diagram of the VELO detector.]{Front view diagram of the VELO detector in fully closed (\textit{left}) and fully open (\textit{right}) configurations \cite{Barbosa-Marinho:504321}.}
	\label{fig:2:VELO_xy}
\end{figure}

The VELO detector comprises 42 silicon modules along the beam direction, each consisting of a pair of half discs measuring the radial and azimuthal track coordinates respectively. These modules cover the $1.6 < \eta < 4.9$ positive pseudorapidity range, as well as some negative pseudorapidity portion to improve primary vertex reconstruction, and are able to detect particles emerging from primary vertices with $|z| < \SI{10.6}{\centi\meter}$.
Due to high risk of radiation damage during beam injection from the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) into LHC, these modules can be retracted by \SI{3}{\centi\meter} in so-called \textit{fully open} configuration, whereas during collision phase the VELO operates in \textit{fully closed} configuration (see Figure \ref{fig:2:VELO_xy}).

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graphics/02-lhcb/VELO_xz.png}
	\caption[Cross section diagram of the VELO detector in the $xz$ plane.]{Cross section diagram of the fully closed VELO detector in the $xz$ plane at $y=0$ (top view). Radial sensors are depicted as \textit{solid} segments, azimuthal sensors as \textit{dashed} segments \cite{Barbosa-Marinho:504321}.}
	\label{fig:2:VELO_xz}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:2:VELO_xz} shows the $xz$ plane cross section of the VELO modules; the two halves of the detector are $z$-shifted by \SI{1.5}{\centi\meter} to ensure full azimuthal acceptance, resulting in the partial overlap seen in fully closed configuration.
Four radial-only \textit{pile-up sensors}, part of the Level-0 hardware trigger system (see Section \ref{sec:2:data_flow}), are placed upstream to help veto multiple-interaction events.



\subsubsection{Tracker Turicensis}
The Tracker Turicensis (TT) \cite{Barbosa-Marinho:582793}, formerly known as Trigger Tracker, is a $\SI{150}{\centi\meter} \times \SI{130}{\centi\meter}$ tracking station located just upstream of the dipole magnet.
Its placement serves the main purpose of tracking low-momentum particles, which would otherwise be bent out of the detector by the magnet without reaching the T stations.

The TT consists of four readout layers of silicon microstrip sensors arranged in a $x$-$u$-$v$-$x$ configuration (vertical in the first and last layers, rotated by a stereo angle of $\mp 5^\circ$ in the second and third layer respectively) for a total active area of $\approx \SI{8.4}{\meter}$.
A \SI{200}{\micro\meter} strip pitch ensures a single-hit resolution $\lesssim \SI{50}{\micro\meter}$.

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{graphics/02-lhcb/TT_layout.png}
	\caption[Front view of the third TT layer.]{Front view of the third TT layer (different readout sectors are labeled with different shadings) \cite{Alves:1129809}.}
	\label{fig:2:TT}
\end{figure}

The third TT layer is depicted in front view in Figure \ref{fig:2:TT}.
The basic unit of a layer is the \textit{half module}, covering half the LHCb height acceptance.
Each half module consists of a row of seven sensors bonded together to form either three or two \textit{readout sectors}.
Modules near the beam pipe are of the former category, with four sensors bonded in the L sector, two in the intermediate M sector and a single sensor for the K sector closest to the beam ($4$--$2$--$1$ modules);
other modules forgo the K sector and bond the spare sensor in the M sector ($4$--$3$ modules).
Front-end readout hybrids, one for each sector, are placed at the L-end of the half modules, outside of the detector acceptance, connected directly to the L sector and indirectly to the M and K sectors via Kapton flex cables.

\subsubsection{T stations}
The three T stations, labeled as T1--3, are the last line of defense for LHCb tracking purposes.

Come figura dell'IT 5.24. Da qualche parte ho letto il momento minimo per arrivare alle T (espresso in GeV/c), menzionalo per dire la soglia minima di misura delle T station. History of LHCb spiega che IT è vicino alla beam pipe, OT no (però sono anche spazialmente spostati, quindi vai a capì. Usa anche i TDR qui, che è utile.
