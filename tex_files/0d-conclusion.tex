Electric and magnetic dipole moments of particles are sensitive to physics within and beyond the Standard Model.
In this thesis I worked on various aspects of the \demonstratorshort decay analysis in preparation of a first measurement of the \lz electromagnetic dipole moments at LHCb.

%% @todo: riscrivi in prima persona.

Less than half of candidate \lambdadecay events reach convergence in the vertex reconstruction process.
Topological studies on a sample fo simulated events show that this is a result of a conflict of information in $xz$ (bending) and $yz$ (non-bending) track propagation planes.
Through further investigation in the measured kinematic variables and comparison with the Monte-Carlo-generated values, I exposed a systematic underestimation of $p_z$ in pion tracks reconstructed from hits in the T1--T3 downstream tracking stations.
